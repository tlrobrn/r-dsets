# DisjointSets

An implementaion of the disjoint sets data structure in Rust.

## Docs

Run `cargo doc` to generate the documentation in ./target/doc  
The index page can then be found at ./target/doc/disjoint_sets/index.html

## Testing

Run `cargo test` to run the doc tests and integration tests.

This ensures that the crate will be usable by other modules, and that the documentation is up to date as well.
